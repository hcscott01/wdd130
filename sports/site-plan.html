			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Our purpose is to help to bring AZ fans together. Haven't you ever felt passionate about sports? Well, having a way to track them brings you all together! This website would be a good way of achieving that.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Our Audience is of course anyone that is likes sports, but of course if you like AZ you would especially enjoy this site!</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I plan to have a site doevoted to highlights. I think what I might do is I might try to have a vote section on the best AZ team, that or the best highlight. Another idea was to make a section where people can predict their season and if they will win or lose. Another thing I was thinking was having a quiz in there about the AZ players. </p>

                  Devin Booker - Devin Armani Booker was born on Ocotober 30, 1996, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He is a shooting guard in the NBA.
                  On June 25, 2015, Booker, was selected with the thirteenth overall pick by the Phoenix Suns in the 2015 NBA draft. He went on to make his NBA debut two days before his 19th birthday, in the Suns' season opener against the Dallas Mavericks. He became the first player in NBA history to debut at 18 years old after playing at least one year of college basketball. On February 12, Booker scored 23 points in a close victory for Team USA in the 2016 Rising Stars Challenge. The following day, he competed in the NBA All-Star Weekend's Three-Point Contest, becoming the youngest contestant to ever participate in the event and only the fourth rookie to compete in the 30-year-old contest. He finished fourth in the 2016 NBA Rookie of the Year Award voting and earned NBA All-Rookie First Team honors. </p>
          
                <p>

Durant went on to become a four-time scoring champion for the organization, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder after his Rookie of the Year campaign, and in 2014 he was voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Durant went on to lead the Golden State Warriors to back-to-back NBA championships, before being traded to the Phoenix Suns in January of 2023.</p>

                  Kyler Murray- Kyler Murray was born on August 7th, 1997 in Bedford, Texas. He is a quarterback in the National Football League. Kyle Murray was selected in the first round with the first overall pick by the Arizona Cardinals in the 2019 NFL Draft. He will reunite with head coach Kliff Kingsbury, who had been recruiting Murray since his Sophomore year of high school. The pick also made Murray the first player to be drafted in the first round of both the NFL and MLB drafts. The selection will mark the first time that two quarterbacks from the same university have gone in the first round in successive seasons, with Baker Mayfield also being selected first in the 2018 NFL Draft. Murray is the first sub-six foot tall quarterback chosen number one in an NFL draft.</p>

In Game 7 of the 2023 National League Championship Series, Carroll went 3-for-4 with two stolen bases, becoming the second-youngest player in MLB history with at least three hits and two steals in a playoff game, just behind Ty Cobb when he did it in the 1908 World Series at 21 years old.
